## Spotify Popularity Project Overview

Hey there, 

You are viewing a machine learning project I helped develop and think through for my DS 3001 - Practice of Data Science class. One fellow classmates and I used a Kaggle dataset of over 170,000 songs from Spotify to explore how radio hosts can pick new songs that are likely to be popular among a general crowd. We conducted EDA on the dataset, looking for which features might influence popularity and where our prediction variable cutoff should be. Later we created a decision tree model, tuned its hyperparameters and tested it on our data. Please see the full report here: https://rpubs.com/kmrowed/RadioHits.

To run the code yourself:
- Download the zipped code to a location where you can retrieve the path name (e.g. "/User/robot/Desktop/data.csv"
- Change the file name in the data import section of the R Markdown file to that path name
- Run the code!


Please enjoy our analysis!
