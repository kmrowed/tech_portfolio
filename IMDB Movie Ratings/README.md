## IMDb Movie Ratings Project Overview

Hi there,

You are viewing a project I helped develop and orchestrate for my DS 2003 - Data Visualization class. Two fellow classmates and I used kaggle dataset of IMDB's top 1000 movies to explore. We cleaned the data in R, graphed some interesting variables, added loess lines and neat analytical features, and then added a UI interface overtop of our visualizations. Lastly, we presented our project to the internet using a Shiny App.

Hope you find this project engaging!
