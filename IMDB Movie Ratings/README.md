## IMDb Movie Ratings Project Overview

Hi there,

You are viewing a project I did for my DS 2003 - Data Visualization class. We used kaggle dataset of IMDB's top 1000 movies to explore. We cleaned the data in R, graphed some interesting variables, added loess lines and neat analytical features, and then added a UI interface overtop of our visualizations. Lastly, we presented our project to the internet using a Shiny App.
