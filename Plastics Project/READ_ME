Hello! 

You are viewing my plastics research presentation project. 
I used financial data, as well as a plastic audit from Tidy Tuesday to understand a few big questions.
I cleaned the data using Python in the "Python Notebook" file and then did exploratory data analysis using Tableau in the "Tableau Notebook". 
I knitted my findings together in a presentation that highlighted big culprits of plastic pollution like Coca-Cola.

I hope you enjoy my project!
