## Plastics Project Overview

Hello! 

You are viewing my plastics research presentation project. 
I used financial data, as well as a plastic audit from Tidy Tuesday to understand a few big questions.
I cleaned the data using Python in the "Python Notebook" file and then did exploratory data analysis using Tableau in the "Tableau Notebook". 
I knitted my findings together in a presentation that highlighted big culprits of plastic pollution like Coca-Cola.

To run the code yourself:
1. Download the data to a location where you can retrieve the path name (e.g. "/User/robot/Desktop/data/plastics.csv")
2. Change the file name in the data import section of the Jupyter Notebook file to that path name.
3. Run the code!

I hope you enjoy my project!
