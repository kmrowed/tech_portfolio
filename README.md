## Tech Portfolio Overview

Hi there,

You're viewing a portfolio of small projects I have recently completed including a report and a tutorial.
These projects are represented by folders named according to the project topic found in this repository.
They include data cleaning notebooks using Jupyter, api connections, data engineering processes such as ETL (extract, transform, load)
as well as data vizualization through Tableau.

I hope you learn something useful from these projects. Thank you for viewing them!
