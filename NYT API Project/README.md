## NYT API Project Overview

Hey there!

You are viewing my New York Times API tutorial project. 
I accessed data from The New York Times' movie review API with a specific focus on Tarantino films.
I imported the data into a pandas dataframe, then imported and exported data from local MySQL and MongoDB servers. 
This project shows capability in reading and writing data to and from databases. 

Thanks for checking my project out!
