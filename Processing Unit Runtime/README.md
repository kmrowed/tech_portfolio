## GPU Runtime Paper

Hello,

This project was a collaboration for a UVA data science class called "Big Data Systems". This paper is the result of research done by Noah Dunn, Nate Lindley, and myself. 
Together, we set up CPU, GPU, and TPU instances in various cloud computing settings, then tested the run times of various algorithms to determine which processing unit had 
the fastest run times. Feel free to read the paper linked in this folder.

Enjoy.
